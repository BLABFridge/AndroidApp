The current plan for the Android app is two buttons and a display screen.

The buttons:
1. Returns sorted list of the fridge.
2. Returns a sorted list of items expiring by specified date

There will be a second screen for viewing the lists, and reading the notifications.
This window will have a back button to get back to the main screen.
