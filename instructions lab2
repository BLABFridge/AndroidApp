part 2:
Find a "Linux Router" machine. Boot it in fedora (not the rescue one)
Connect the pi's to the switch (the white thing with d-link on it)
Copy the files to the pi:
	If you have a USB drive, use that
	If your laptop has a SD slot, pull the SD card from the pi (after shutting it down), load the files on the SD card and then put it back in the pi.
	If not, run (on the linux router machine) scp [file].[ext] pi@[pi IP]:[same file].[same ext], yes to RSA authentication, password is raspberry
Run UDPreceiver on the pi. the python one does not work on the pi.

part 4.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	If this does not print 1, find a new linux router where it does
run ifconfig -> your network adapter (probably enp1s0) should have ip 10.0.0.1
On the pi:
	sudo -i #this makes you root
	chmod 666 /etc/resolv.conf #this changes the permissions of the file so you can write to it
	push ctrl-D # this logs you out of root, back to user 'pi'
	echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf #this sets your nameserver, if you know a different dns server that you prefer, you can use it
	Now you should be able to ping google.ca
	If you can, you have internet access, do whatever you want with the interwebs
